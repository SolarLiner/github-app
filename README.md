# github-app [working title]
An app to stay connected on your favorite repositories (like this one!).

This is a personal project to get me into the mobile app development, using Dart and the Flutter framework.

## Contributing

This repository uses Git Flow. The master branch is protected, which means all work must be done on feature branches.
